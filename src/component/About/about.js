                <p className="w-50 mx-auto">Food texture is defined as those properties of a food that are sensed by touch in the mouth and with the hands. We use many words to describe food texture—foods can be soft or hard, mushy or crunchy, or smooth or lumpy. Texture is important to the enjoyment and acceptability of foods. Would you enjoy a mushy apple or soggy toast?</p>

                <p>Older adults with chewing and swallowing problems may not be able to safely eat foods with regular textures. They may need to eat only soft foods, or they may require that foods be cut up or ground/minced. Offering foods that normally have a texture that is easier to swallow, such as cooked cereal, pudding, and yogurt, may be recommended. Gravies and sauces may need to be added to foods to ensure that foods are moist enough to swallow. Some older adults with swallowing problems require a puréed diet—a diet where foods are blended to a smooth texture. When foods are ground or puréed, the taste of the food changes—liquids may be added during preparation, which may then dilute or mask the flavor of the food; gravies or sauces may be added to ensure the food is moist but may also change the flavor of the food. Microwave reheating can change the taste of the texture-modified food. Aroma, which is closely related to taste, may be decreased or altered during preparation as well.

                Once texture has been modified, taste becomes a very important sense used to identify the food. Enhancing the natural flavor of the food may help with food recognition.

                Adding a little sugar or other sweetener goes a long way to improving the acceptability of some texture-modified foods such as sweet vegetables, while adding a dash of salt, gravy or a flavor enhancer to meats is recommended. Serving "hot foods hot" and "cold foods cold" improves flavor and acceptability too and is very important for food safety!

                Enhancing the flavor of foods has also been shown to increase the flow of saliva and improve immunity (Schiffman 2000). Highly flavored food stimulates swallowing and mastication.
